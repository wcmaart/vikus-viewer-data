# vikus-viewer-data
Data folder for Vikus Viewer + setup scripts.

## Setting up
Plan is for this to be a git submodule(?) possibly for the `wcmaart/vikus-viewer` repo, but for now, the best option is to 
1. put it in a separate folder
2. make a symbolic link in `vikus-viewer` that points to `vikus-viewer-data/data` (since `vikus-viewer/data` is `.gitignore`d).  
```bash
cd vikus-viewer
ln -s ../vikus-viewer-data/data ./data 
```
## What's inside
- **`data`**
  - `colors.csv` = the new CSV with color data (generated by the python scripts in the `development` branch)
  - `config.json` = now has a `loader.grid` element for the grid view
  - `data-full.csv` = 7MB, carried over from the files shared before
  - `data.csv` = collection data
  - `info.md` = markdown for the expanded info sidebar
  - `timeline.csv` = timeline data
  - `tsne.csv` = TSNE data from TensorFlow
